What is NIC
A network interface, often referred to as a NIC (Network Interface Card) or a network adapter, is a hardware component or a virtual component 
that allows a computing device to connect and communicate with a network. In the context of cloud computing and infrastructure management, 
such as in platforms like Azure or AWS, a network interface represents a networking component associated with a virtual machine (VM) or 
another networked resource.


Why ip_configuration_name         = "Internal"
For instance, when creating a network interface for a virtual machine in Azure, you might define an IP configuration with a specific name, 
such as "Internal," to represent a particular set of network settings. This configuration might be associated with a private IP address or 
linked to specific subnets within a virtual network
